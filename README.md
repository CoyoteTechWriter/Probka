## <a name="core"><b>2. The Core Value of the registration process </b></a>


<br>


The core value I see in the registration process is probably data protection. Thanks to the registration procedure, all the data that must be provided, are well-protected against unauthorized access. 

Another core value is collecting information. For most enterprises, data regarding customers, their needs, and expectations are one of crucial factors for their existence and future development. That’s why virtually all websites require registration process.
